# PR Introduction

First of all, thank you for considering to raise a pull request!

Don’t be afraid to ask for advice before working on a contribution. If you’re thinking about a bigger change, especially that might affect the core working or architecture, it’s almost essential to talk and ask about what you’re planning might affect things.  Some of the larger future plans may not be documented well so it’s difficult to understand how your change might affect the general direction and roadmap of this project without asking.

The preferred way to communicate is probably via Discord or GitHub issues.

Helpful information to understand the project can be found here: [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
